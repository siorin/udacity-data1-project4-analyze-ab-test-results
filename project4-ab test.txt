For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab

PROJECT SPECIFICATION: Analyze A/B Test Results

Code Quality
CRITERIA - MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

Functionality of code - All code cells can be run without error.

Use of Good Coding Practices - Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.


Statistical Analyses
CRITERIA - MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

Correct Interpretation of Results - All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.

Correct Values for All Statistical Results - For all numeric values, you should provide the correct results of the analysis.

Statement of Conclusions - Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.


Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
To go above and beyond, you may try to add the influences associated with time on conversion. In adding this variable to your analysis, it would be best to create dummy variables for different aspects of the time. Correctly coding and interpreting the results related to time along with the existing effects would benefit the analysis.

Additionally, you could add interpretations related to model fit, and why particular models fit better than others.
